Note that the LoadShapes.txt files for all feeders/networks have included -by mistake- the location of files
used during our simulations. For instance, you will see something like:

>>> file=C:\2014\ENWL_Network_Creation\Feeder_Representation\Load_files_Model\Load_profiles\Load123_5min.csv

You will need to update that part of the code according to your own files. Using the MS Excel files with
the LCT profiles, you will need to create individual CSV files for each load, or alternatively, do something
clever coding :-)

Enjoy! And share the knowledge!
